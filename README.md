## About Dataset

**Content:**

This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.
Predicting which set of the customers are gong to churn out from the organization by looking into some of the important attributes and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning on it.

Customer churn refers to when a customer (player, subscriber, user, etc.) ceases his or her relationship with a company. Online businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customer's last interaction with the site or service.

A Predictive Churn Model is a tool that defines the steps and stages of customer churn, or a customer leaving your service or product. ... But with an evolving churn model, you can fight for retention by acting on the metrics as they happen

Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. ... Similar concept with predicting employee turnover, we are going to predict customer churn using telecom dataset.

## Abstract
Customer churn, a phenomenon that causes large financial losses when customers leave a business, makes it difficult for modern organizations to retain customers. When dissatisfied customers find their present company's services inadequate, they frequently migrate to another service provider. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) approaches have already been used to successfully identify customer churn. In some circumstances, however, ML/DL-based algorithms lacks in delivering promising results for detecting client churn. Previous research on estimating customer churn revealed unexpected forecasts when utilizing machine learning classifiers and traditional feature encoding methodologies. Deep neural networks were also used in these efforts to extract features without taking into account the sequence information. In view of these issues, the current study provides an effective method for predicting customer churn based on a hybrid deep learning model termed ANN. The goal is to effectively estimate customer churn using benchmark data and increase the churn prediction process's accuracy. The experimental results show that when trained, tested, and validated on the benchmark dataset, the proposed ANN model attained a remarkable accuracy of 81%.
